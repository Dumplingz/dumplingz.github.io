I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at the <a href='https://cs.uchicago.edu/'>University of Chicago</a>, advised by Professor <a href='https://raulcastrofernandez.com/'>Raul Castro Fernandez</a>. I am broadly interested in data systems, and I am currently working on <a href='https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p3172-xia.pdf'>Data Station</a>, a system for enabling data sharing.
